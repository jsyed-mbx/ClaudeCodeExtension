## Features

- **Embedded AI terminal** — Run any supported AI coding agent inside a Visual Studio tool window. Auto-detects the solution directory; restarts when you switch solutions. Optionally use Windows Terminal instead of Command Prompt for better emoji/Unicode rendering.
- **Multi-line prompts** — Press **Enter** to send, **Shift+Enter** or **Ctrl+Enter** for a new line. Toggle "Send with Enter" off in the ⚙ menu to make Enter insert a newline and reveal a Send button.
- **File and image attachments** — Paste images with **Ctrl+V**, drag & drop files onto the prompt area, or use the 📎 button. Any file type is accepted (no limit). Text content like Excel cells pastes as text, not as an image.
- **Editor selection → prompt** — Click 📋 or right-click selected code → *Send Selection to Claude Code* to insert a formatted snippet (file path + line numbers + syntax-highlighted code fence) into the prompt.
- **Integrated diff viewer** — For Git projects, the 📊 view shows uncommitted changes in a dedicated tab with search, auto-scroll, double-click-to-open, and double-click-line-to-navigate. Optionally auto-opens when you send a prompt.
- **Prompt history** — Last 50 prompts saved (with attached files). Browse with **Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down**; clear via right-click.
- **Claude Code session history** — 📜 toolbar button lists past sessions for the current workspace; resume any session or the most recent one with one click. Works for native and WSL Claude Code.
- **Claude usage in VS** — 📊 button (when Claude is active) opens the claude.ai usage page inside a dockable tab. Inline session/weekly progress bars below the prompt update automatically and adapt to the active theme.
- **Custom commands (⚡)** — Save slash commands or canned prompts and dispatch them to the active agent in one click. Configure via *⚙ → Configure Custom Commands...*.
- **"@" file picker** — Type **@** in the prompt box to search your solution's files and folders and insert one with the keyboard; keep typing to filter, arrow keys + Enter to insert, pick a folder to drill in.
- **On Agent Finish** — Optionally play a sound, show a notification (with duration, plus token count for Claude Code), and run an action (build/rebuild, run, tests, a script, or a follow-up command) when the agent goes idle. Global defaults plus per-solution overrides. Configure via *⚙ → Settings...*.
- **Model selection (Claude)** — 🤖 button to switch between Opus / Sonnet / Haiku and pick an effort level (Auto / Low / Medium / High / Max) for Opus thinking depth.
- **Detach / attach terminal** — Pop the terminal into a separate VS tab and bring it back at any time. State persists across sessions.
- **Theme aware** — Follows VS dark/light theme automatically, or force dark, light, or a custom background color via *⚙ → Settings → Theme*. Prompt and terminal zoom (Ctrl+Scroll) are persisted across sessions.
- **Persistent settings** — Layout, provider choice, model, flags, and zoom level all saved to `%LocalAppData%\ClaudeCodeExtension\claudecode-settings.json`.

## Supported AI Providers

By default only **Claude Code** is shown in the agent picker — use *⚙ → Configure Visible Code Agents...* to opt in to the others. The active agent always remains visible.

| Provider | Platform | Command | Subscription / Notes |
|----------|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Claude Code | Windows / WSL | `claude` | Claude Pro or higher. [Setup docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup) |
| OpenAI Codex | Windows / WSL | `codex` | ChatGPT Plus or higher. Optional `--ask-for-approval never` toggle |
| Cursor Agent | Windows / WSL | `agent` / `cursor-agent` | Cursor account. Optional `--yolo` toggle |
| Open Code | Windows | `opencode` | Node.js 14+; provider configured via `Ctrl+P` → "connect providers" |
| Windsurf | WSL | `devin` | Windsurf paid plan. Optional `--permission-mode dangerous` toggle |
| PI | Windows | `pi` | Node.js + Git for Windows |
| Google Antigravity | Windows | `agy` | Google account. Optional `--dangerously-skip-permissions` toggle |

If a provider isn't installed, the extension shows the install command automatically when you select it. The **Update Agent** entry in the ⚙ menu runs the right update command for the active provider (e.g. `claude update`, `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest`, `cursor-agent update`).

## System Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 or 2026 (x64 or ARM64)
- Windows 11
- Plus whatever the chosen AI provider needs (see table above)

## Installation

1. Download the latest VSIX from this page or search for "Claude Code Extension" inside Visual Studio's **Manage Extensions...** menu
2. Double-click the VSIX file to install or install inside Visual Studio, then restart Visual Studio
3. First time only: Open the tool window via **View → Other Windows → Claude Code Extension**

> If the terminal opens in a separate window instead of inside the extension panel, open Windows Settings → search "Terminal settings" → set **Terminal** to **Windows Console Host**.

**Optional — Windows Terminal**: For better emoji and Unicode rendering, install Windows Terminal from an elevated Command Prompt:
```
winget install --id Microsoft.WindowsTerminal -e
```
Then choose it via *⚙ → Set Terminal Type...*.

## Quick Start

1. Click ⚙ → pick your AI provider (use *Configure Visible Code Agents...* if it isn't listed)
2. If using Open Code, run `Ctrl+P` → "connect providers" once to authenticate
3. (Claude only) Pick a model via the 🤖 button
4. Type a prompt, press **Enter** to send. Attach files with Ctrl+V, drag-and-drop, or 📎
5. Watch the agent work in the embedded terminal. For Git projects, open 📊 to see live diffs

## Settings & Menus

**⚙ Settings menu** (gear button, top-right):
- Pick an AI provider, *Configure Visible Code Agents...*, *Configure Custom Commands...*, *Set Theme...*, *Set Terminal Type...*, *Set Working Directory...*
- Toggles: *Send with Enter*, *Auto-open Changes on Send*, *Prompt panel position (top/bottom/left/right)*, *Disable Auto Zoom on Startup*, *Send large prompts as file*
- Provider-specific flags: Claude *Skip Permissions*, Codex *Approval Never*, Cursor *Yolo Mode*, Windsurf *Dangerous Mode*, Antigravity *Skip Permissions*
- Update Agent, Detach/Attach Terminal, About

**🤖 Model menu** (Claude only): Opus / Sonnet / Haiku, effort level for Opus (Auto / Low / Medium / High / Max), Change Account, Install Caveman plugin.

**On Agent Finish**: Configure via *⚙ → Settings... → On Agent Finish...*. For scripts, enable *Close script window when it finishes* to auto-close the script console. For *Run (F5)* and *Run without debugging (Ctrl+F5)*, use *Clean solution before running* and *Rebuild solution before running* to control whether the solution is prepared before launch.

**Custom commands (⚡)**: Once you've added a command via *Configure Custom Commands...*, the ⚡ toolbar button appears. Clicking an entry sends the saved text verbatim to the active agent — useful for slash commands or canned prompts.

### Recipe — Codex review of uncommitted code, dispatched from Claude Code

This binds a Claude Code skill that shells out to OpenAI Codex to audit pending changes for bugs, security issues, performance problems, and code quality.

1. **Install Codex CLI** (if needed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @openai/codex
   codex login
   ```
2. **Create the skill from inside Claude Code** — paste this prompt into a Claude Code session:
   > Create a Claude Code user skill called `codex-review` at `~/.claude/skills/codex-review/SKILL.md`. The skill runs `codex review --uncommitted` against the current repo's uncommitted changes. Preconditions: verify git repo, verify uncommitted changes exist, skip non-meaningful diffs (config/lockfiles/whitespace), and verify `codex` is on PATH. Ask Codex for bugs, OWASP Top 10 issues, performance problems, and code quality findings — each with file:line, severity, why it matters, and a concrete fix. Codex is the reviewer; Claude relays the output verbatim. After creating the file, run `/reload-plugins`.
3. **Bind it as a custom command**: ⚙ → *Configure Custom Commands...* → Add... → Name: `Codex Review`, Command: `/codex-review`.
4. **Use it**: ⚡ → *Codex Review*. Claude runs the skill, Codex audits your diff, findings appear inline.

## Version History

### Version 21.0
- Non-English text (such as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean) typed in the prompt box now reaches the terminal correctly instead of arriving as garbled characters (issue #79).
- Agent output in the terminal is now readable under a light Visual Studio theme — accent colors like cyan and blue are painted in darker, legible tones instead of washing out against the light background (issue #80).

### Version 20.0
- Terminal zoom (Ctrl+Scroll) and right-click paste now keep working after the agent's interface is fully up, not just during startup — previously both stopped responding once the agent took over the terminal (issue #78).

### Version 19.0
- Terminal zoom (Ctrl+Scroll) and paste now keep working when signed in with a custom API key — previously some sessions left the mouse zoom and right-click paste unresponsive, and the extension now falls back automatically so both behave the same as a normal sign-in (issue #76).

### Version 18.0
- Replying to the agent's questions with the arrow keys is now reliable when "On Agent Finish" is enabled — while the agent waits for your answer the completion watcher leaves the focused terminal alone instead of fighting you for keyboard focus, so you no longer have to click the terminal repeatedly before a keystroke registers.

### Version 17.0
- Removed the Fable option from the Claude model menu — choose Opus, Sonnet, or Haiku.

### Version 16.0
- Changes to "On Agent Finish" settings now take effect for a turn that is already running — the new settings are applied when the agent finishes, instead of only on your next prompt.

### Version 15.0
- Arrow keys now work reliably while navigating the agent's question and selection menus in plan mode when "On Agent Finish" is enabled — the completion watcher recognizes the menu sooner and stays backed off as you move between options, instead of eating keystrokes.

### Version 14.0
- Fixed "Restart code agent" leaving the panel blank after an "On Agent Finish" notification had fired — previously the panel could stay broken until Visual Studio was reopened (issue #73).
- Arrow keys and typed answers now work reliably when replying to the agent's questions in the console while "On Agent Finish" is enabled — the completion watcher now backs off while the agent waits for your reply.

### Version 13.0
- "On Agent Finish" scripts can now close their console window automatically when they finish.
- "On Agent Finish" Run and Run without debugging actions can now clean and rebuild the solution before launching, and those preferences are saved.

### Version 12.0
- Loading or switching solutions now avoids repeated terminal attach attempts and no longer keeps retrying the same failed launch, reducing blank terminal panels after a new solution opens.

### Version 11.0
- Fixed "Restart code agent" leaving the panel blank on machines where the previous agent session shuts down slowly (issue #73) — the restart now waits for the old session to fully terminate for every provider before launching the new one, instead of only for WSL.
- Clicking the agent terminal now reliably focuses it even when the machine is busy (issue #74) — previously the focus could be silently taken back by Visual Studio right after the click, making the terminal impossible to select while the agent was working hard.

### Version 10.99
- Fixed the agent terminal staying stuck on a previously chosen custom background color after switching the theme back to Automatic, Dark, or Light — the terminal now always matches the selected theme.

### Version 10.98
- Opening or switching solutions no longer restarts the code agent several times in a row — the agent now starts once in the right folder, which also fixes most cases of the panel coming up blank right after loading a new solution.
- When the launch does fail to attach, the extension now waits for the old session to fully shut down and retries for longer before giving up.

### Version 10.97
- The terminal now retries the whole launch a few times when it comes up blank after "Restart code agent" or when switching solutions, recovering on its own from the brief startup failures that previously left the panel empty until you clicked restart again.

### Version 10.96
- More fixes for the panel staying blank after "Restart code agent": the panel now repairs itself when its hosting area was torn down, and attach failures show an error instead of silently leaving the panel empty until Visual Studio is reopened.

### Version 10.95
- More fixes for the terminal coming up blank after "Restart code agent": the restart now retries once when the terminal closes itself right after launch, and reports an error with a log file path instead of silently leaving the panel empty.

### Version 10.94
- Clicking the agent terminal now reliably focuses it with a single click, so you can immediately answer the agent's questions — previously it could take a second click before typing reached the terminal.

### Version 10.93
- The "On Agent Finish" run-script action now correctly runs `.cmd`/`.bat` and `.ps1` scripts and keeps their window open afterward, so you can read the output instead of the console flashing closed (or a PowerShell script just opening in an editor).

### Version 10.92
- The "On Agent Finish" notification now greys out with an explanation when Windows Terminal is selected, since it only works with the Command Prompt terminal — previously it could be enabled there but silently did nothing.

### Version 10.91
- Removed the "Don't bring Visual Studio to the foreground on terminal click" setting. Windows requires the Visual Studio window to be activated for typing to reach the embedded terminal, so the option could not work reliably and has been retired; clicking the terminal always brings Visual Studio forward again.

### Version 10.90
- Fixed the terminal coming up blank after "Restart code agent" (and other agent restarts) when an "On Agent Finish" notification was enabled — previously the panel could stay empty until Visual Studio was reopened.

### Version 10.89
- Added the new Fable model to the Claude model menu — select "Fable - Most powerful" to switch the running session to Claude's top-tier model.

### Version 10.88
- Fixed the "Don't bring Visual Studio to the foreground on terminal click" setting: clicking the terminal no longer pulls the whole Visual Studio window forward when the option is enabled, so overlapping window layouts stay intact.

### Version 10.87 - ArgoZhang contribution
- Configurable CLI executable path settings, now in a "CLI Paths" tab in the Settings window: point any provider at a specific executable, or leave it empty to use the default detection. A warning appears on save if a path doesn't exist.

### Version 10.86
- The Prompt / Paste Image box now has a drag grip on its bottom edge so you can resize the prompt area directly without hunting for the splitter below the buttons. The grip keeps a minimum prompt size so the input stays usable.

### Version 10.85
- New "Custom background color" theme option under Settings → Theme: pick any color with the color picker or type a hex value (e.g. #F4ECFF) to set the terminal panel and console background.

### Version 10.84
- The Settings window is now organized into tabs (Behavior, Layout, Terminal, Theme, Usage), making each group of options easier to find.
- New "Send prompt with" choice adds a Ctrl+Enter option: Enter inserts a newline and Ctrl+Enter sends, so a stray Enter tap no longer submits an incomplete prompt.
- Prompt font size and the inline usage bar options (show/hide and auto-refresh) can now be set directly in Settings, plus a "Reset to Defaults" button.

### Version 10.83
- Running multiple Visual Studio instances no longer causes the selected AI agent and model to get mixed up across windows. Each instance now keeps its own provider/model choice in memory and only writes it to the shared settings file on shutdown.

### Version 10.82
- New opt-in setting to prevent clicking the embedded terminal from bringing the entire Visual Studio window to the foreground. Useful when overlapping multiple VS instances and you want to interact with the terminal without rearranging your layout. Enable via Settings → "Don’t bring Visual Studio to the foreground on terminal click".

### Version 10.81
- The prompt panel can now be docked on the left or right (a side-by-side split) in addition to the top or bottom. Pick the position under Settings → Layout.

### Version 10.80
- Fixed the prompt becoming unresponsive to the keyboard (cursor not blinking, arrow keys not switching agents) while the embedded terminal still accepted typing — clicking in the extension now restores keyboard input without restarting Visual Studio.

### Version 10.79
- Fixed the prompt and its attached files being sent two or three times when the Send button (or Enter) was pressed again before a send finished.

### Version 10.78
- Fixed updating the PI agent failing because the extension tried to type "exit" — it now quits PI with CTRL+D twice before running the update.

### Version 10.77
- The "On Agent Finish" settings now open in their own window via a button in Settings, and you can keep different settings per solution — turn on "Use custom settings for this solution" to override the global defaults for just the project you're in.
- Fixed the embedded terminal breaking when you switch to a different solution while the agent-finish notification is enabled. Pending notifications are now cleared when a new solution loads.
- The agent-finish notification and action no longer trigger while the agent is waiting for your input (a yes/no confirmation or a selection prompt); they now wait for the real completion after you answer.
- Fixed the agent-finish watcher occasionally interfering with typing in the terminal — it no longer reads the console while you're actively typing there.
- Fixed the agent-finish notification taking much longer than the idle time you set — it no longer waits until you click away from the terminal, so it appears at the configured time.
- Fixed Visual Studio occasionally freezing while an agent-finish action ran (such as running the app).

### Version 10.76
- Added an optional notification when the agent finishes a task — play a sound and/or show a Visual Studio bar with how long it took (and, for Claude Code, how many tokens it used). It works by noticing when the terminal goes idle, so it covers any agent running in the Command Prompt terminal.
- The notification can also trigger an action when the agent is done: build or rebuild the solution, run it (with or without debugging), run your tests, run a script like deploy.cmd, or send a follow-up command back to the agent. Configure it under Settings, "On Agent Finish".
- Added an "@" file picker in the prompt box: type "@" to search your solution's files and folders and insert one without leaving the keyboard. Keep typing to filter, use the arrow keys and Enter (or click) to insert, and pick a folder to drill into it.

### Version 10.75
- Fixed the Claude Usage panel showing the claude.ai homepage and cookie banner instead of your usage, and not staying signed in across Visual Studio restarts.

### Version 10.74
- Added Antigravity to the marketplace tags so the extension is discoverable when searching for it.

### Version 10.72
- Fixed the Session History dialog showing "0 sessions found" when the project path contains non-English characters (e.g. Japanese) — the session list now loads correctly for these paths.

### Version 10.71
- Added a "Disable clipboard" option in the Settings dialog for users whose clipboard is held by another app (clipboard managers, Remote Desktop, security tools). When enabled, prompts are saved to a temporary file and a short reference is typed into the terminal with simulated keystrokes instead of being pasted.

### Version 10.70
- Fixed a system-wide keyboard and mouse freeze (and prompts occasionally landing in the wrong window) that could happen while sending a prompt when another app was contending for the clipboard. Input handling now runs independently of the editor, so it stays responsive during a send.

### Version 10.69
- Fixed the Update Agent button for Antigravity — it now exits the agent correctly before updating, so the installer runs instead of being typed into the running agent.

### Version 10.68
- Fixed Windsurf not launching when a new solution is opened while the terminal was already running — it would fall back to a plain command prompt until you manually restarted the agent. Windsurf now loads automatically like the other providers.

### Version 10.67
- Sending a prompt no longer aborts with a "Clipboard Verification Failed" pop-up when a clipboard manager or background app briefly holds the clipboard — the send now proceeds and a tolerant comparison ignores harmless line-ending differences. Strict abort behavior is still available via a new opt-in toggle in the Settings dialog.

### Version 10.66
- Clicking the embedded terminal now brings Visual Studio to the foreground even when another app is on top.

### Version 10.65
- Internal build fix for the editor context menu registration. No user-facing changes.

### Version 10.64
- XAML controls and their code-behind moved into a dedicated UI/ folder. No user-facing changes.

### Version 10.63
- Internal source tree reorganized into Controls/, ToolWindows/, Models/, and Package/ folders for easier navigation. No user-facing changes.

### Version 10.62
- Splitter between terminal and prompt can now be dragged fully to the top or bottom to hide either panel.

### Version 10.61
- Auto-reopened **Claude Usage** tab no longer steals focus on solution load.

### Version 10.60
- **Show Usage** menu item now displays a checkmark when the usage view is open.

### Version 10.59
- Consolidated layout, terminal type, theme, send behavior, auto-zoom, and auto-open changes into a single **Settings...** dialog in the ⚙ menu.
- Added an opt-out for the "Theme Changed" restart prompt for users who auto-switch themes when debugging.

### Version 10.58
- README cleanup: trimmed version history to user-visible features. Fixed outdated **Update Agent** button reference (now a menu item) and clarified installation source.

### Version 10.57
- README slim-down and shorter marketplace description.

### Version 10.56
- Inline usage bars now readable on light theme.

- New **Disable Auto Zoom on Startup** setting (useful on 4K / high-DPI displays).
- Faster terminal startup zoom.

### Version 10.51
- Usage page auto-confirms corporate proxy block screens.
- **Send large prompts as file** (opt-in) — avoids paste truncation on big prompts. PR #51, rbuss93.
